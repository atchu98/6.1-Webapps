<!-- This is a comment block. Multi-line and single line comments are the same in HTML. -->
<!--
�  The DOCTYPE above tells the browser how it needs to display the file.
�  The DOCTYPE MUST be the first line in the document, before any comments or whitespace.
�  The browser doesn't read file extensions and so this is the only way it knows how to correctly display the content.
�  This shows the browser that it should use HTML5.
-->
<!--
�  The whole HTML document is encapsulated in <HTML> tags explain the difference between tags and elements here if not covered in XML)
�  HTML is based upon XML and so has opening and closing tags
-->
<html>
	<!--
	�  The <head> tag contains metadata about the web page.
	�  Anything inside the head isn't displayed.
	-->
	<head>
		<!--
		�  The title tag contains the title of the current page.
		�  Some browsers use this for the text shown in the tab or at the top of the Windows bar.
		-->
		<title>Title of the web page</title>
		<!--
		�  The link tag allows the HTML page to link to an external stylesheet that holds CSS rules.
		�  More about CSS rules to follow in a later example.
		�  The rel attribute explains the relationship between the current document and the file being linked to.
		�  The href attribute stands for Hypertext Reference. It is a relative path from the root of the web server.
		-->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.CSS" />
		<!--
		�  Meta tags are key-value stores.
		�  The name attribute is used to specify the key and the content is the value.
		�  In this example, search engines read the 'description' key and use the content to give a brief snippet of what the website is for.
		�  There are other recognised meta tag names such as 'author' and 'keywords'.
		-->
		<meta name="description" content="Our First Website. Designed to show the basic structure" />
		<!--
		�  The head element is ended by the </head> closing tag, note the forward slash.
		-->
	</head>
	<!--
	�  The Body tag defines the body of the HTML document.
	�  Everything inside the body tag is rendered to the page.
	�  It contains all of the contents of HTML document.
	-->
	<body>
		<!--
		�  This tag is used to display a heading, we can use H1 through to H6 depending on the level of heading.
		�  A web page is built up of different tags, these HTML tags are used to define the structure of the document.
		�  CSS is used to add styling to the web page. Styling and structure MUST be kept separate by pushing styling into CSS stylesheets.
		�  id attributes are used to identify a specific element.
		�  An element can only have one id and and id can only be associated with one element.
		-->
		<h1 id="main-title">Our First Web Page</h1>
		<h2 id="sub-title">This is a sub heading</h2>
		
		<!--
		�  These tags are 'anchor' tags. They are use to create links to other pages.
		�  They are inline elements, meaning they will be positioned next to each other from left to right.
		�  The href attribute is used to tell the browser what page or website to link to.
		�  href values can be absolute or relative paths.
		�  The class attribute is used for applying CSS styling.
		�  We can add multiple classes to one element and multiple elements can share a single class.
		�  All HTML elements can have one or more classes.
		�  We will show how CSS uses these class names soon.
		-->
		<a class="button" href="about.HTML">About</a>
		<a class="button highlight" href="contact.HTML">Contact</a>
		<a class="button highlight" href="http://www.fdmgroup.com">FDM Group</a>
		
		<!--
		�  divs are block level elements.
		�  div tags are used for 'divisions', they help us define a structure for the HTML document.
		�  divs are often used to encase multiple elements into a group.
		�  Sometimes they are used as 'wrappers' or 'containers'.
		-->
		<div class="wrapper">
			<!--
			�  p tags are used to contain the text of a paragraph. They are block elements.
			�  They can contain inline elements as well as text.
			�  If they do contain inline elements, they appear inline with the rest of the text.
			�  Use http://www.lipsum.com/ to generate nonsense text.
			�  TRAINER-TIP: usually a p tag is all on one line, this one has been broken up to fit the 
				comments about <img> tags in.
			-->
			<p>
				<!--
				�  img tags are used to hold images, they are inline elements by default.
				�  They have a src attribute where we state the source of the image.
				�  TRAINER-TIP: We can use https://placeimg.com/ to gerenate placeholder images for use on the course.
				-->
				<img src="https://placeimg.com/100/100/nature" />
				<img src="https://placeimg.com/100/100/arch" />
				<!--
					TRAINER-TIP: Add the class of float-right in the next demo.
				-->
				<img class="float-right"src="https://placeimg.com/100/100/people" />
